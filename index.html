    <h1>Temples are a house of God</h1>
    <p>The Lord said, “Build a house to my name, for the Most High to dwell therein” (D&C 124:27). The Lord’s Spirit dwells in His temples. The temple is a house of God. It is a place where we make covenants (or promises) with Heavenly Father. If we keep our covenants, we will be able to live with Him again.</p>
    <h2>What happens in the temple?</h2>
    <p>Everyone must be baptized to return to Heavenly Father. Many of Heavenly Father’s children died without being baptized. After you turn 12, you can be baptized in the temple for those people so they can have the same blessings.</p>
